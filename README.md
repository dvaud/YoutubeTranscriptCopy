# YoutubeTranscriptCopy
Reveal and copy the transcript of (almost) any YouTube video with a few clicks!

I made this because I wanted to watch videos about a show that I was watching, but I was always scared that it would contain spoilers. So I opened the transcript, copied everything (the UI is so bad, it always selected the whole page), threw it in an LLM and asked if it contained spoilers (usually Gemini with search).
I got tired of this, so I collaborated with Claude and made this little extension. I would have tried doing it myself, unfortunatly I don't know any JS ðŸ˜›

After you download this you have to go into Manage Chrome extensions, check developper mode and load in the package. It should work after that.
